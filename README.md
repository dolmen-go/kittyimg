## Status

A [basic API](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/dolmen-go/kittyimg/) (`Fprint`, `Fprintln`) allows to display an image (loaded with stdlib's [image](https://golang.org/pkg/image/) package) at the cursor position.

```
go get github.com/dolmen-go/kittyimg
```

A command-line tool (`icat`) is provided.

```
go install github.com/dolmen-go/kittyimg/cmd/icat
```

## See also

The Go Playground has [support for displaying images](https://play.golang.org/p/LXmxkAV0z_M) with its own protocol (`IMAGE:` prefix followed by base64 image file data).
